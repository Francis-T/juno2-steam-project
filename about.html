                                    <p>
                                    Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Data Sciences are fueling the 
                                    development of innovative solutions for various applications in smart connected communities (SCC). 
                                    These solutions are typically data-driven, thus making them vulnerable to data integrity attacks. 
                                    Some solutions leveraging human as active agents may be susceptible to selfish behavior due to 
                                    incentive gap between individual and social objectives in SCC.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    At the same time, the exponential increase in velocity and volume of data has created a bottleneck 
                                    for computing resources in the communities. This has catalyzed the growth in shared computing paradigms, 
                                    such as edge/fog computing. The shared nature of computing resources makes the data integrity attacks 
                                    even more likely, thereby reducing trust in decision quality of SCC applications, such as smart mobility 
                                    and smart energy. Additionally, the increasing dependence on dynamic data-driven support systems implies 
                                    that any operational breach in the underlying SCC networks or services due to attacks or failures will 
                                    have cascading effects. Lastly, such attacks will not only cripple the SCC operations but also escalate 
                                    customers' privacy concerns influencing the extent to which they are willing to share data. This in turn 
                                    will affect the quantity of information required to make robust decisions, making trustworthiness in SCC 
                                    applications very challenging.

                                    <p>
                                    This collaborative proposal between US and Japan, called STEAM, aims to develop novel integrated frameworks 
                                    to address important security and trustworthiness challenges in two emerging SCC applications -- smart 
                                    mobility and energy. In particular, considering various threat models, we propose innovative solutions to 
                                    five inter-related research thrusts:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Secure and trustworthy decision making under uncertainty, by developing efficient anomaly detection 
                                            and trust models;</li>
                                        <li>Integrating privacy-preserving computations with secure and trustworthy decision making schemes by 
                                            adopting fully homomorphic encryption (FHE);</li>
                                        <li>Characterizing trade-offs between security, privacy and available resources; </li>
                                        <li>Developing a secure and trustworthy middleware architecture as applied to smart mobility and energy, 
                                            that incorporates privacy-preserving algorithms, resource constraints, and trustworthiness of data 
                                            sources and decision making schemes; and </li>
                                        <li>Evaluating the architecture and proposed solutions with exemplar case study applications.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Intellectual Merit</h2>
                                    <p>
                                    The novelty of the STEAM project lies in the integrated approach to handling security and
                                    trustworthiness of two interdependent SCC applications, in the domain of smart mobility and energy, by
                                    developing innovative privacy-preserving FHE compatible algorithms and models for anomaly detection,
                                    trust and reputation scoring, such that privacy is not sacrificed for the sake of security. Additionally, we
                                    study trade-offs between security, privacy, trust levels, resources, and performance. Our proposed secure
                                    middleware architecture makes FHE computations and trustworthy decision making available to the
                                    application services. Our hypothesis is that if we are successful, then we will see the next big step in
                                    reliable privacy-preserving data-driven decision support systems, which are required if we want to
                                    encourage active participation of customers in the data economy of SCC.

                                    <h2>Broader Impacts</h2>
                                    <p>
                                    The STEAM project will not only have tremendous scientific impacts on securing SCC applications
                                    including smart mobility and energy, but also on CPS and IoT. It will further provide a unique platform
                                    for interdisciplinary education, training, and experiential learning for undergraduate and graduate
                                    students across five partner institutions in the US and Japan. The PIs propose to jointly develop and offer
                                    a new course on "Securing Smart and Connected Communities" via distance education. This course will
                                    emphasize hands-on security projects with lab exercises designed around smart mobility and energy
                                    testbeds. Due to societal relevance and team-oriented collaboration approach, the STEAM project will
                                    help attract women and underrepresented minority students. Moreover, smart vehicles and IoT
                                    applications will encourage K-12 students to participate in summer camps organized at partner
                                    universities. Research findings and project outcomes will be widely disseminated via a dedicated website,
                                    invited talks, tutorial and seminar presentations.
